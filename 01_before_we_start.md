# Oracle MCP Lab

## Overview
This repository contains a personal hands-on lab for exploring a modern development workflow with **Oracle MCP (Multitenant Control Plane / Managed Cloud Platform)**.  
The main goal of this project is **self-learning**  to experiment with different tools and approaches for building and managing Oracle code in a modern development environment.

## Objectives
- Practice using **SQLcl** with Oracle MCP.  
- Explore integration with **Visual Studio Code** and **SQL Developer**.  
- Learn how to create, manage, and version Oracle code in a structured and modern way.  
- Build personal experience with collaborative development workflows using GitHub.  

## Scope
This lab is not intended as production code.  
It is a sandbox for **self-study**, testing, and experimenting with:
- SQL and PL/SQL scripts
- Database development best practices
- Environment setup (e.g., Docker, Terraform)
- Modern tooling around Oracle databases

## Structure
- `docs/` – Lab guide and documentation  
- `src/` – SQL, PL/SQL, and supporting code samples  
- `env/` – Environment setup (Docker, Terraform, configs)  
- `examples/` – Example use cases and scripts  
- `tests/` – Optional test automation  

## Next Steps
1. Set up the environment.  
2. Connect SQLcl, VS Code, and SQL Developer to Oracle MCP.  
3. Run initial scripts and verify connectivity.  
4. Iterate and improve workflows for Oracle development.
